- Each project page (`project1.html`, `project2.html`, `project3.html`) follows a consistent layout with the project name at the top, the project description on the left, and the project image on the right.

## Assets
- Images and documents are stored in the `assets` directory. Ensure that all images used in the project pages are placed in the `[project-images]` folder.
